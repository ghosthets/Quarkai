## 🚀 Overview

**Quark-AI** is a proprietary, ground-up Large Language Model (LLM) architecture designed to move beyond the limitations of standard Transformers. It features a unique **24-layer hybrid backbone** specifically engineered for **stateful reasoning** and **dynamic memory retention**.

Unlike traditional models that treat every token in isolation, Quark utilizes a specialized **Recurrent Memory Slot (RMS)** system, allowing it to maintain a "thread of thought" across complex prompts.

## 🛠️ Key Architectural Innovations (Classified)

<blockquote>
  <b>Note:</b> To protect the intellectual property of the Quark architecture, the core source code is currently <b>Private</b>. Documentation below highlights high-level capabilities.
</blockquote>

### 1. **Persistent Memory Slots**
Quark doesn't just attend to context; it stores compressed reasoning states in dedicated slots, reducing hallucination in long-form logic tasks.

### 2. **NTK-Aware Adaptive Scaling**
Equipped with Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) aware Rotary Positional Embeddings, Quark is designed to scale its context window dynamically without losing precision.

### 3. **Layer-wise Reasoning States**
Each of the 24 layers participates in a "Chain-of-Thought" process before producing the final output vector, ensuring deeper semantic understanding.
